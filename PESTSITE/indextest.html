They seem to not even care about their being food anymore. They just enjoy the warmth of my house. I do live in Northern Canada so I understand the need for warmth but there is a line to who I let live in my home. I tried everything from the classic mouse trap all the way to sonic blasts. Nothing seemed to work until…. I got mouse no more. This product not only solved my mouse problem, but it introduced me to such a nice man. Rick Sullaway is a hero in my mind.</td>

He is the most gentle giant I have ever met…. If you have mice but don’t want to kill them and maybe even save them then you MUST get this product.</td>

And I'm not talking the whopping twenty dollars you have to spend on this. I'm talking the toxicity of the product. I sprayed it near my garden and two weeks later. Dead. Everything! It must have been this product.</td>

Or how do we know he didnt use special effects to make it seem that he licked the mouse no more? I don't trust videos these days.</td>
