I was an atheist, and now I am a believer in God. There was an amazing dramatic shift in my life. The quality of life went so high. I would say my scale of quality of life was a 2/10, and now that I believe in God, my quality of life has risen to an 8/10. I used to argue, as an atheist, that the action is important and not so much the belief. But what I believe now is that the genuine belief in a real God makes a profound difference. It is so important to believe in God for a lot of reasons. It has specific stress relieving properties. It is statistically proven that believing in God makes you live longer. It does make you happier because when you actually believe in God, it gives you hope in having eternal life. However, the old world believed in God to give you a spiritual eternal life. They believed God would give you special protection if you believed. Now we know we can just utilize this belief to actually physically live forever on earth.

        I was trying my best to be a god-fearing atheist. I was praying to a god that I didn’t believe in. But now I am praying to a god that I actually believe in. While you could sum this up to some kind of placebo effect but, as we all know, the placebo effect is powerful.

        There is also an agnostic approach, where we don’t know what the rules are, and we have to just feel around. But the reality of this is that if we don’t have to guess everything and there is a specific set of rules we know about, then we can feel better about our faith. There is not one thing that Jesus said that is not totally awesome. It is obvious and easy to look to. I get where people come from when they say there are so many religions, and how do we know where to look to. It is obvious that it is Jesus. Clearly, he stands out in his teachings as more truthful. You need to be motivated to actually obey the rules. When you are guessing, there is not much motivation. But when you know specifically what the rules are. Then you are actually more motivated to follow the rules.

        It is like a relationship. Imagine you are married. If you believe that your significant other really loves you and exists. Then you are going to be very motivated to love back. When you believe in God, then you are more motivated to do good. When you love your significant other it helps to know they love you. When you believe God is good, then you are more able to do good. If we are obeying God’s rules, then the hope to achieve eternal life is more real.

        Belief is not as easy as switching a switch. You can do things, though, that help you believe. Pray, taking the lords supper, and other things are available to help yourself believe. But you must seek after the ability to see God. You need that consideration. Eventually, you will figure out how to see God.

        Most people think conscience is just a product of evolution. You might not be able to follow your conscience if you think this because you can reduce it to biological systems. But once you believe your conscience is a God given conscience, then you are more able to follow what your conscience says. It is totally coming from God. All the time your conscience is telling you what to do. If you reduce that conscience to just an arbitrary outcome of evolution, then you have nothing.
