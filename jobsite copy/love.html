       <p> Love

        People obsess about relationships and neglect to focus all that time on something more important. You could devote some of that time to something like stopping aging. 
        
        Some people think that putting time and money into a family.
        
        Relationships are among the most challenging things us human being can engage it
        
        
        We need to have a more eternal perspective on things. We need to stop rushing our love life. Eternal life is much more importation that relationships. You have an eternity to find the perfect partner. Relationships are necessary to be happy. How can you be happy without a relationship? Some people do need a relationship like a crutch. A lot of people need a pet just like a lot of people need a relationship. It takes a lot of strength to refuse a weak relationship that is possible. If you die, then your tragic relationship is even more sad. Even a good relationship is rendered tragic when you die. It is not an added benefit, it makes it even more sad. It might actually take you a thousand years to find your eternal love. This is supposed to be motivational though. This should drive you to want to live forever. It is certainly a good thing. You need to wait for that perfect one person you meet in the future. If you already found that person you want to live with forever then it is good that you found them. Don’t settle because sometimes you feel rushed because you have a temporary outlook on life. It is very simple. Just find the person you want to live forever with and then end your love search. Don’t settle. Without forced love, you can focus more on allowing yourself to live forever.
