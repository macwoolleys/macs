    <p>The Schwulst reading made me really excited about beginning to learn how to make a website. I liked the website as thrown rock that’s now falling deep into the ocean because I feel like there are a lot of things I like to make for a brief period and then completely let it go. It is a small example, but in middle school when Instagram first started becoming a thing for my friends and me, we would make endless accounts each with a specific purpose. One account that I recently stumbled back on was a promotional page for a production release that was never going to happen. Another thing that comes to mind are the countless one-off zines I have made that ended up lost or destroyed. These are things that I felt should be made at one point but never meant to fully invest in. Websites are another medium that can serve these quick bursts. With this article and the A Rant About “Technology” article, the ability to create a website opens a lot of doors. I really like how Le Guin wrote that technologies are what we can learn to do.  </p>

    One thing that resonated with me was the point about how websites continue to exist in the medium they were created in. Many artifacts of the past and present are stored in places that might attempt to maintain a certain level of consistency with where the artifacts came from but there is always a kind of filtering that occurs. For example, when you watch an old movie on your laptop. The movie was shot on celluloid film but over the years it has been processed into a more accessible medium that is different from the original. This process is inevitable for many mediums, but websites have a certain ability to maintain their medium with ease. You could print out the contents of a website but people would only do this for very specific reasons that would not come up regularly.

    <p>I think it was interesting how in the beginning of the essay, we are led in with the simple premise that we will be reading about Choi’s experience building a computer. Towards the end of the piece we are reading about how cities are like computers for humans the larger significance of that connection. I like how when that connection is being made it feels like that connection must be made when beginning to do something like build a computer. I often think of looking at an ant hill as a kid and being told, “This is no different from our cities.” </p>
