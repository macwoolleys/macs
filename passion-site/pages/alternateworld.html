<div class="box"> Dirt From Road</div><br><p class="ex1">
    This dirt was found out in the road during one winter that I spent almost completely with my Grandparents out in New Jersey.

<div class="box2">Dirt From Basement</div><br><p class="ex1">It is hard to know exactly where you get things sometimes. However, this is not the case for this sample of dirt. I collected it during recess in third grade under the math trailer. The trailer had a little crawl space underneath it. The dirt under the trailer was soft. I guess because it got all turned up when they put the trailer there. I scooped some up and had to put it in my pockets because I wasn’t anticipating on collecting any. For the rest of the day, I walked around with my pockets filled with dirt. While I look back fondly on this, whoever buys this dirt will not have any true emotional connection to it, so I am reducing the price from $30 to $02.</p><span class="explanation"> <input type="submit" value="Buy"><select name="me" id="me">

<div class="box3">Dirt From Ocean City</div><br><p class="ex1">The beach is very much loved by people. The water is nice and there are usually rides and game nearby. I like the beach too. Lakes are good but different. This dirt is from Ocean City Maryland. It almost looks like sand, but it is not. People always mistake it for sand but do not worry. For anyone who doesn’t know, dirt can be made up partially of sand and usually is, but sand is just a component. You wouldn’t ask someone for a cake and expect to just get flour. This is sandy dirt though.</p><span class="explanation"> <input type="submit" value="Buy"><select name="me" id="me">
