                ......... ..... ..... .....sleepy... sleepy......  at in ms raniers/koffles class. At first there were these religious guys setting up a little thing for prayers. I kept using it but not praying and pretending to the more religious than I was. I would bring whatever they had at the stand to guys in the class and saying look what I got. There would be lollipops and candy. Then on tv there was a soccer game John Peterson was really into. It was a college game. An ex loyola guy was on the sidelines cheering for his team. It looked like Ryan Dunn almost. The school was amengelen or something like that. It seemed like a really classic cool school. White and green colors. I thought the school was really cool and wanted to go somewhere like it. John said that the boy was the greatest sportsman he ever knew. Ms ranierey said that was an important statement and asked why. And John said he could do anything he wanted. On tv the boy was cheering hard for his team even though they were loosing by a lot. I was pretending not to watch but was fixated. 

Another dream I was leaving a loyola basketball game early and me Davali would not let us pass his circle. There was a crack between his team and the bleachers but he said we would have to wait. I was getting my mad and tried ti walk through. He tried to stop me. I burst at him and said that I thought he was a good guy and I liked his science class but it was crazy he wasnt letting us through. He said he would have ti send me to the principle.

in this dark hallway and these two girls brought this big monsterous plant out of a room. Its leafs were brown and drooping. I thought of my plant. Then they sat it down and pulled this chain light switch and these massive light bursted onto the plant. Slowly the plant leaves started to rise and turn green.
