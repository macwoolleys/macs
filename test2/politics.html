        Everyone knows that the two-party system that governs the United States needs to come to an end. I think the community that is going to break that system is the transhumanist community. There is already the transhumanist party, and it is quickly gaining numbers. People in this community are the most passionate group of people in politics because of how strongly they believe in their cause. People who are trying to live forever have the pressing desire that fills them every day and the party must harness this power. The party has a lot of ground to cover but I think if they make the right moves, then they could really gain some traction.

        Right now, there needs to be more emphasis on the science of things. It is strange that so many leaders are devoid of any scientific fact. We are a scientific species and our whole society is based off science, but we have the most scientifically illiterate people running the world. Our politicians talk about scientific topics and none of them have ever read a scientific research paper in their life. I think if the party capitalizes on this lack of science in politics by pushing scientists to be associated with the party, then we could make a breakthrough.

        The transhumanist party is the party to back.
